We made a simple script using bash, a type of computer language, to create a local Kind cluster. The name of the script is deploy_kind_cluster.sh. This cluster is like a mini version of a real one and is set up right on your own computer locally. We have other method like, minikube, K3s, but we chose kind reason being this is quick to set up.   After we have established our nodes are running, we extract the kube config from the (HOME/. kube/config) directory which we will need much later. The name of file is config. Next, we build a basic hello-world-app using Node.js Express and deploy to Dockerhub, to store the program. Inorder to do this, we have to write a Dockerfile which entails the instructions needed to store the program. Next we create a Manifest deployment file, a tool that manages the kind cluster we created earlier, how to run the app, named hello-world-deployment.yaml, however we won't be using it as we will de using a differernt tool called terraform to deploy. With Terraform, Using the Kubectl terraform provider, we'll write a terraform code as seen on the Main.tf and the provider.tf that deploys the manifest deployment file to the kind cluster.
